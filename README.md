# Systems Integration (Electrical Engineering)

Utilities, libraries, examples, and documentation related to Applied Electrical Engineering for different kinds of Systems Integration tasks and problems.

This work is based on my academic experience, personal research, and professional history in R&D, Data Science, IT Support, Test Engineering, and Software Engineering.

## Very Small Aperature Antenna (VSAT) Systems

VSAT System-Integration is essentially the coordination of modular electronic devices for RF/IF mixing, Modulation-Demodulation of signals, and  transmission/reception of energy.

VSATs are essentially antenna-dishes and components that are "Portable Earth-Stations" for facillitating a satellite link.

The code and documentation, here, addresses the nuanced technical aspects of Signal Processing and Spectral Characteristics for integrating the components that go into typical VSAT Systems.

I've never had any kind of government clearance, and I no longer work for a VSAT integrator or manufacturer, so everything provided here is of my own designs, based in publically available datasheets, and is meant for educational/conversational purposes only.

## Vehicle Systems using CAN bus

The [Controller Area Network (bus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) is a standardized hardware and software communications system utilized in contemporary vehicles to coordinate the electrical and electromechanical systems.

## Audio/Video Systems
